House Price Prediction Using Linear Regression
🏠SCT_MLTask2 – House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

📌 Task Objective
To build a supervised machine learning model that predicts house prices based on features like size, location, number of bedrooms, etc. This task focuses on understanding linear regression and improving model accuracy through preprocessing and evaluation.

🧠 What I Did
Loaded and explored the house_prices.csv dataset

Cleaned data: handled missing values and outliers

Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify correlations and trends

Applied feature engineering (e.g., encoding categorical variables)

Built and trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated model performance using RMSE and R² Score

Visualized predictions and residuals for analysis

🛠 Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy – Data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Model training, evaluation

(Optional: XGBoost & RandomForest can be mentioned if you extend the notebook)

📊 Output
Successfully trained a Linear Regression model to predict house prices

Visualized the relationship between actual and predicted prices

Analyzed residuals and performance metrics

(Optional) Compared results with other regression models

📚 What I Learned
Supervised learning through Linear Regression

The importance of data preprocessing in model performance

Hands-on experience with EDA and feature selection

Model evaluation using RMSE and R² Score
